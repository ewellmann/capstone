# Capstone Project: Azure Machine Learning Engineer

The Capstone Project for the Azure Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree allows us to apply your knowledge and skills to solve a real-world problem using Azure Machine Learning. We will create two models, one using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and another with customized hyperparameters using HyperDrive. The project requires us to compare the performance of both models and deploy the best one as a web service. We will also need to submit a README file detailing the data, models, performance, and deployment process.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
The Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle is a widely used dataset in the field of healthcare and machine learning. It contains clinical records of 299 patients who experienced heart failure, including various demographic, clinical, and laboratory features. The dataset provides valuable information such as age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and more.

The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart failure based on these features. It is a classification problem where the target variable is a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of heart failure.

By using this dataset in our project, we can train machine learning models to analyze the relationship between these features and heart failure, and ultimately build a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk. This dataset offers a valuable opportunity to apply our machine learning skills in a real-world healthcare context

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
